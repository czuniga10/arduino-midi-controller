CSIS-2810 Arduino Midi Controller Team Project. (Main directory is /MIDI_Controller. The others are just us sharing code together before we merged it all together.)

## About

Currently, our goal is to create a functional midi controller with buttons, knobs and LCD display.
Constructed within a clear case!
